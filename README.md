# MentalHues
### Hello, my name is Erin. Throughout my own struggles with a mental health disorder, I have found my largest source of struggle comes from the misunderstandings I feel from others when symptoms of my disorder disrupt my daily living.  
### If I could do anything to help others right now, it would be to diminish the stigma that we with mental health disorders currently face. My skills involve computer science and technology; thus, I believe I am most useful with a computer, skills I have been learning along the way, and community support. I hope to generate an open source community that can help me chip away at stigma associated with mental health disorders.  In doing so, I hope we provide a space for people to personalize mental illness issues and break down all our misunderstandings.
# What is MentalHues all about?
### I am working with the mental health community and the open web to create a web application that the greater community can use to better understand issues associated with mental health disorders. I want people to engage on issues in an anonymous, personal way, to find ways to create better understanding for mental health and related topics.
# Get Involved!
### Even at the beginning stages, there are a lot of ways to help!
